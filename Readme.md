See .NET Task MoviesDB.docx file for full specs.

Very simple movie library app

The file scripts/InitDatabase.sql should be used to create the database

The unit tests are so few, I wish I had more time to cover more logic.

The initial project was generated using Sencha VS plug-in.

Resources used during the work:

http://extjs.eu/ext-examples/#grid-and-form

http://examples.sencha.com/extjs/6.0.2/examples/kitchensink/#binding-child-session

the whole extjs documentation/examples/etc

tested under Chrome/Edge/IE/Firefox
